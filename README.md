# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the Project

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.

## Features

- **Weather Forecast**: Fetches daily weather data from an API.
- **Clothing Recommendations**: Suggests appropriate clothing based on the weather forecast.
- **Add New Items**: Allows users to add new clothing items to their wardrobe.
- **Delete Items**: Users can delete clothing items from their wardrobe.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes for a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: For handling routing in the application.
- **CSS Grid and Flexbox**: For responsive layout design.
- **API Integration**: Fetches weather data and manages clothing items.
